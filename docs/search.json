    "text": "Hi, I’m Nacho — welcome to my portfolio! I built this site with Quarto as a more dynamic version of my résumé, a place where I can share more about who I am, what I do, and the projects I’ve worked on.\nI studied Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara’s Bren School, focusing on clean energy and community resilience. For my master’s project, I created a tool to show how solar can reduce emissions and lower electricity costs, and I later grew that work into a social impact venture with support from Bren’s Eco-Entrepreneurship Council and the California Nanosystems Institute. I also bring a background in anthropology and archaeology from the Universidad Nacional de La Plata in Argentina, where I researched Native communities in Patagonia and the Andes. After graduating, I launched an archaeology consulting firm in Santa Barbara before shifting my focus to spatial data and energy resilience.\nThese days, I’m a contract spatial data scientist at Collective Energy Company, where I help design and deploy solar + battery microgrids for health centers across the U.S. Our goal is to keep critical facilities powered during outages, wildfires, and other climate-driven challenges.\nThanks for visiting — I’d love to explore ways we can work together!"
